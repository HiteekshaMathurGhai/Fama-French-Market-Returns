Replicating Fama French Market Returns

Calculating equal-weighted and value-weighted market return, and the lagged total market capitalization using data from CRSP.
The aim is to replicate market return time series on the Kenneth French website: https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html

For both the equal and value weighted time series, I have calculated the follwoing moments using risk-free rate of return:
annualized return, annualized volatility, annualized Sharpe ratio, skewness, and excess kurtosis.
